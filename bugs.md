# Testing
* wxChoice doesn't react to mouse clicks during testing

# Misc
* Very long loading time for editor windows
* Exiting via alt-F4 while editor window is open (running event loop) crashes the game

# GUI
* add item dialog is broken when inserting items dynamically in subclasses of main class
* Tooltips don't show - in wxDialog they do

# Code
* Fetching item images is broken - weird colors
