# Testing
* Redo Asserter class to use own log sink and log messages instead of converting them to text and concatenating, reason: ability to click on each error in error message rather than big block of text
* wxChoice doesn't react to mouse clicks during testing

# Misc
* Tooltips don't show
* Very long loading time for editor windows
