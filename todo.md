# Testing
- Redo Asserter class to use own log sink and log messages instead of converting them to text and concatenating, reason: ability to click on each error in error message rather than big block of text
- more test functions in Asserter like assertTrue, assertFalse, assertAnyThrow (from googletest) etc.
- project parts requiring tests:
    -

# Misc

# GUI
- inventory control - handle item position

# Code
- Auto convert structure parameters in hookFunction and hookReplaceCall to their addresses
- Json persisting methods boolean return values should indicate actual error in all cases, not empty data or error
- big one: should accessor "generic for" functions providing index to callback, provide the exact index that was used as first or 0-based index for iteration? Both have pros and cons:
    - first option allows you to index a table with exact provided index if you needed to, but doesn't let you know which iteration of the loop is running;
    - while second is inverse - you don't know how to index real data table, but know which iteration of the loop is currently running.
    - I think the first one is better, because you can always know current iteration by capturing counter variable, while you might not know the exact index that is used as first
- redo "enum" handling code to allow to extract all automatically generated code to its own file (to allow easy future changes), make second file containing changeable code and provide "hook" to allow to change static part from dynamic part (for example, to allow to add extra stats, that is "enum" fields)

# Low level
- automatically store hook restore data to abstract unhooking (see hookRestoreDataMap variable)
- redoing asm compiling functions to two-pass system (compile, get size, alloc memory, compile again with origin at this memory), allowing to have "absolute" keyword as in MMExt

# Design
- simple "randomize item" dialog, where you would input item type, treasure level etc. and call vanilla function
- use event loop when opening main window to make editor/generator modal for easier programming and more intuitive design

# Uncategorized
- better callbacks: add way to remove them, using probably some kind of token
- add all functions to lua wrapper, add method to pcall, using LuaTypeInCpp as return values and args
- somehow change LuaTypeInCpp to be own class, where you can add methods etc.
- add "is" method to LuaTypeInCpp
- add "getOr" method to LuaTypeInCpp, which would get the value if it is correct type, otherwise return default value and maybe boolean indicating if it was correct type
- big one: create a system for allowing getEventActivator for lua events with arbitrary number of arguments, using vector of LuaTypeInCpp as parameter and return value
- test bytecode hooks (use asm tests for this, grab generated bytecode and compare it with expected from asm test)
- complete callMemoryAddress tests
- change all appropriate hook functions to call checkOverlap() before doing anything
- test codeMemoryAlloc family of functions
- create all struct accessors and their methods (generic for)
- use ArrayData in all places where it is appropriate (mainly in struct accessor methods)
- somehow handle differences in structs from elemental mod (and other mods, but this one has most)
- test all methods in wrappers for game data (PlayerSkill, PlayerStat etc.) and add missing ones
- use hook functions in real scenarios?
- analyze base classes for GUI classes (like PlayerPanelBase), to see, if their interface should be changed
- handle json serialization and deserialization for all classes (using RTTR when appropriate?)
- create some tests for the above
- find use cases for RTTR and use it
- test GameTime and TimeChooserCtrl classes
- document all classes and methods (using doxygen)
- create lua scripts for getting all data from lua (for example, spell data is missing)
- find a way to make all classes in the project have the same interface for serialization and deserialization
- extend lua wrapper to allow calling functions with arbitrary number of arguments
- overload appropriate LuaWrapper functions to accept LuaTypeInCpp as arguments
- do something with LuaTypeInCpp to make it more useful
- find a way to make LuaTypeInCpp work with RTTR
- better error handling in lua wrapper
- generate RTTR data for all classes
