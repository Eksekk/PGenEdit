# Testing
- Redo Asserter class to use own log sink and log messages instead of converting them to text and concatenating, reason: ability to click on each error in error message rather than big block of text
- more test functions in Asserter like assertTrue, assertFalse, assertAnyThrow (from googletest) etc.
- project parts requiring tests:
    -

# Misc

# GUI
- inventory control - handle item position

# Code
- Auto convert structure parameters in hookFunction and hookReplaceCall to their addresses
- Json persisting methods boolean return values should indicate actual error in all cases, not empty data or error
- big one: should accessor "generic for" functions providing index to callback, provide the exact index that was used as first or 0-based index for iteration? Both have pros and cons:
    - first option allows you to index a table with exact provided index if you needed to, but doesn't let you know which iteration of the loop is running;
    - while second is inverse - you don't know how to index real data table, but know which iteration of the loop is currently running.
    - I think the first one is better, because you can always know current iteration by capturing counter variable, while you might not know the exact index that is used as first

# Low level
- automatically store hook restore data to abstract unhooking (see hookRestoreDataMap variable)
- redoing asm compiling functions to two-pass system (compile, get size, alloc memory, compile again with origin at this memory), allowing to have "absolute" keyword as in MMExt

# Design
- simple "randomize item" dialog, where you would input item type, treasure level etc. and call vanilla function
- use event loop when opening main window to make editor/generator modal for easier programming and more intuitive design

# Uncategorized
- better callbacks: add way to remove them, using probably some kind of token
- add all functions to lua wrapper, add method to pcall, using LuaTypeInCpp as return values and args
- somehow change LuaTypeInCpp to be own class, where you can add methods etc.
- add "is" method to LuaTypeInCpp
- add "getOr" method to LuaTypeInCpp, which would get the value if it is correct type, otherwise return default value and maybe boolean indicating if it was correct type
- big one: create a system for allowing getEventActivator for lua events with arbitrary number of arguments, using vector of LuaTypeInCpp as parameter and return value
- test bytecode hooks (use asm tests for this, grab generated bytecode and compare it with expected from asm test)
- complete callMemoryAddress tests
- change all appropriate hook functions to call checkOverlap() before doing anything
- test codeMemoryAlloc family of functions
